				<p>The above quote by <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> inspires me to learn. 
				One important part of learning is involvement. This blog is a journal of the 
				process. We have always come across some great programming blogs 
				in our life, paused and wondered what was the process to reach there. 
				We never found that answer.</p> <p> 
				This blog content is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/archeranimesh" 
				title="My Github profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="nickname">archeranimesh
				</span> </a>, in an attempt to have a version control on the blog which helps 
				in finding the history of this blog. If this blog is accepted by the programming 
				faternity in future, you can always checkout the history of this blog and try to 
				copy and paste the approach for your own learning. </p> <p> The programming languages 
				which this blogs will address are <ol> <li>Algorithms</li> <li>C</li> <li>Java</li> 
				<li>Python</li> <li>Android</li> <li>Design Patterns</li> <li>Object Oriented 
				Programming and Design</li> </ol> </p> <p> Programming is a mix of engineering and 
				art, so listening music, photography are some of my hobbies which try to keep the 
				art in me alive.</p>

				You're never going to win big if you're only going to minimize your losses.
