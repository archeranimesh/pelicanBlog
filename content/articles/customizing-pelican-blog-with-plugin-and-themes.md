Summary: Pelican blog has a active community of developers who are always at the look out to modify and enhance the power of Pelican blog. Pelican plugin and Themes are one way of doing the same.
keywords: Pelican themes, Pelican plugins, Flex Vs Elegant vs BootStrap3 Themes.

Pelican Blogs gives its user the full power to customize to the want of the user. We have been using the default themes and default setting provided by Pelican with not much customization and the results are also quite good.

Enhancing the present blog further will require us to use certain Plugins and Themes which will extended the functionality. These are the 2 repository which we should clone into for getting this enhancements.

* [pelican-plugins ](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins "Pelican Plugins ")
    - This is the repository for the plugins.
    - `git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins.git plugins`
* [pelican-themes ](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes "Pelican Themes")
    - This is the themes repository.
    - `git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git themes`


## Plugins Vs Themes ##

The first things which we have to decide is to choose the list of plugins or the Themes we want to use. I would say first decide on Themes and the see what all plugins are required to support this themes. All plugins are not pluggable with all the themes.

We have to first start by choosing the themes, and the corresponding plugin required for it. This path is again the easiest as we are already treading the knowns, when we are comfortable with this integration we can always go ahead and enhance the existing themes and plugins to suit our needs. Till we reach the Jedi stage this pre-cooked solution is the best approach.


## Flex Vs Elegant vs BootStrap3##

When we are deciding on which themes to choose for the blog, broadly the working choice would be 

* [Flex: Responsive Pelican theme ](https://blog.alexandrevicenzi.com/flex-pelican-theme.html "Flex: Responsive Pelican theme ")
* [Elegant Why it is the best Pelican theme ](http://oncrashreboot.com/elegant-best-pelican-theme-features "Elegant Why it is the best Pelican theme")
* [BootStrap3](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3 "BootStrap3")

There are many others, which you are free to explore, but for my blog I had considered these 3 options.
