Summary: Discrete Maths is a study of things which are discrete, which means things which can be counted. Discrete Maths forms the basis of a lot of concepts in algorithms and Computer science in general. I am starting this #100DaysOfX which Discrete Maths, to have a sufficient understanding of the concepts. I am using resources from NPTEL, MIT OCW, and ArsDigita University.

Discrete Maths is a study of things which are discrete, which means things which can be counted. Discrete Maths forms the basis of a lot of concepts in algorithms and Computer science in general. I am starting this #100DaysOfX which Discrete Maths, to have a sufficient understanding of the concepts. I am using resources from NPTEL, MIT OCW, and ArsDigita University.

The plan is to follow the 3 lectures mentioned in the references and the Rosen book on Discrete math.

## Day 04 | Thursday 21 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

* Listened to the 2nd lecture of MIT 6.042J YouTube [play-list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8HKWUWS-lA&index=2&list=PLB7540DEDD482705B) 
* This lecture discusses about 
	- Proof by Contradiction
	- Introduces to the concept of Induction proof.

### Thoughts ###

* Today was focused on listening to the lecture, so have not taken detailed notes.

## Day 03 | Wednesday 20 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

Completed the 2nd Lecture of NPTEL's Discrete [Maths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uTE24o3q-o&list=PL0862D1A947252D20).

### Thoughts ###

Today I learned about:-

* Proving implication without drawing all possible rows of truth table.
* Proved that implication is not associative.
* Learned about logical identities.
* Simplified complex compound propositions.
* Conversion between English to logic and vice versa.
* Rules of inference
	- Modus Ponens
	- Modus Tollens

## Day 02 | Tuesday 19 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

1. Complete the First lecture of MIT 6.042J YouTube play [list ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3LMbpZIKhQ&list=PLB7540DEDD482705B&index=2&t=0s)

### Thoughts ###

* I have not taken any notes, but the lecture was mostly focused on methods of proof, propositions and connectives.

## Day 01 | Monday 18 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

1. Complete the First lecture of NPTEL's YouTube play [list ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlUFkMKSB3Y&list=PL0862D1A947252D20&index=2&t=0s). 

### Thoughts ###

This lecture covers these topics:-

1. Logic
2. Propositions
3. Logical Connectives ($\&$, $|$, $\sim$) and its truth tables
4. Implication. ($\Rightarrow$)
5. Equivalence. ($\Leftrightarrow$)
6. Tautology, Contradiction & Contingency.
7. Logical Identities

Understanding Equivalence and Implication was little tough.

These 2 video's provided the additional help.
