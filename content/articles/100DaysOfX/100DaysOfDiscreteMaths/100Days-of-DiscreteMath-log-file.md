Summary: Discrete Maths is a study of things which are discrete, which means things which can be counted. Discrete Maths forms the basis of a lot of concepts in algorithms and Computer science in general. I am starting this #100DaysOfX which Discrete Maths, to have a sufficient understanding of the concepts. I am using resources from NPTEL, MIT OCW, and ArsDigita University.

Discrete Maths is a study of things which are discrete, which means things which can be counted. Discrete Maths forms the basis of a lot of concepts in algorithms and Computer science in general. I am starting this #100DaysOfX which Discrete Maths, to have a sufficient understanding of the concepts. I am using resources from NPTEL, MIT OCW, and ArsDigita University.

The plan is to follow the 3 lectures mentioned in the references and the Rosen book on Discrete math.

## Day 01 | Monday 18 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

1. Complete the First lecture of NPTEL's YouTube play [list ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlUFkMKSB3Y&list=PL0862D1A947252D20&index=2&t=0s). 

### Thoughts ###

This lecture covers these topics:-

1. Logic
2. Propositions
3. Logical Connectives ($\&$, $|$, $\sim$) and its truth tables
4. Implication. ($\Rightarrow$)
5. Equivalence. ($\Leftrightarrow$)
6. Tautology, Contradiction & Contingency.
7. Logical Identities

Understanding Equivalence and Implication was little tough.

These 2 video's provided the additional help.
