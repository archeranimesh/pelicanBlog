Hello World!, You are about the witness the beginning of an epic third coming of the 100-Day coding journey, A story that great sages
will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and 
unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will be the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will be a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to develop and perfect the skills necessary to evolve into a true beast with these keys.

I have failed in my previous attempt for the challenge, which you can find [here]({filename}../../../articles/100DaysOfX/100DaysOfCode/100Days-of-code-log-file_V_2_0.md "Second attempt for 100Daysofcode").

There are learning from the previous failure, here are the modification which was done to the challenge according to my handicap.

## Day 02 | Saturday June 8,2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

* Understood the VSCode basic settings, got help from a great tutorial by [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4)
* The tutorials talks about these topics
	- Change the way settings is displayed as JSON, in place of UI.
	- Select virtual environment.
	- Change color theme.
	- Change file icons.
	- Set the global python path - `"python.pythonPath": "<Path>"`
	- Set a global python file formatter, we are using Black for this. `"python.formatting.provider": "black",`
		+ Also change the option to run the formatter on saving the file. `"editor.formatOnSave": true,`
	- Enable Linting.
	- Git Integration.
	- Unit Testing.

### Thoughts ###

* VScode has lot of power, lets see how much I learn from it.

## Day 01 |  Friday June 7,2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

* Started the Python Fundamentals course by Nina Zakharenko.
* Today's main focus was setting my these things.
	- Virtual environment.
	- VScode setup.
* Faced few issues, which [stackoverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41687841/there-is-no-activate-when-i-am-trying-to-run-my-virtual-env) helped in solving

### Issues and Solutions ###

* There was no activate script when the virtual environment was created by using the command `python -m venv .env`
	- On doing Google for the problem found that running the same command again solves the issue, so ran `python -m venv env` again and viola the activate script appeared.
* VScode was not recognizing the virtual environment created inside a sub folder in the project.
	- Deleted the pre-existing environment and created a new virtual environment at the project root.

### Thoughts ###

* Programming is just efficient Google technique.
