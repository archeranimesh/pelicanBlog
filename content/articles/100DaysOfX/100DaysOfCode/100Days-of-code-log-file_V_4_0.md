Hello World!, You are about the witness the beginning of an epic second coming of the 100-Day coding journey, A story that great sages
will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and 
unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will be the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will be a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to develop and perfect the skills necessary to evolve into a true beast with these keys.

I have failed in my previous attempt for the challenge, which you can find [here]({filename}../../../articles/100DaysOfX/100DaysOfCode/100Days-of-code-log-file.md "First attempt for 100Daysofcode").

There are learning from the previous failure, here are the modification which was done to the challenge according to my handicap.


Ladies and gentleman, I present to you, #100DaysofCode with @ [animeshkbhadra](https://twitter.com/animeshkbhadra "Twitter Handle")

### Days Progress ###

Completed the CSS Trasform lecture from [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/). It was pretty amazing to learn about various type of transforms

### Thoughts ###

* These are the transform's learned.
  * `rotate` : rotates the object.
  * `skew` : skews the object.
  * `scale` : zoom by a factor.
* We can also combine transition with transforms to give a nice animating effect.
* `translate3d` takes a mandatory z-index as a paramter.
