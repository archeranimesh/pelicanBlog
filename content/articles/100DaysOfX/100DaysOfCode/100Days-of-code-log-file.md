Hello World!, You are about the witness the beginning of an epic 100-Day coding journey, A story that great sages
will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and 
unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will be the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will be a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiat warrior, fighting to develop and perfect the skills necessary to evolve into a true beast with these keys.

Ladies and gentleman, I present to you, #100DaysofCode with @ [animeshkbhadra ](https://twitter.com/animeshkbhadra "Twitter Handle")
