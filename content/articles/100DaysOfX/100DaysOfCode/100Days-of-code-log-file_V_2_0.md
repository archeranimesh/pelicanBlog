Hello World!, You are about the witness the beginning of an epic second coming of the 100-Day coding journey, A story that great sages
will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and 
unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will be the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will be a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to develop and perfect the skills necessary to evolve into a true beast with these keys.

I have failed in my previous attempt for the challenge, which you can find [here]({filename}../../../articles/100DaysOfX/100DaysOfCode/100Days-of-code-log-file.md "First attempt for 100Daysofcode").

There are learning from the previous failure, here are the modification which was done to the challenge according to my handicap.

* Selected the resource in advance, 
	- [Learn Python Track from Team TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-python)
	- [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2BE3D6CA77BB8F7)
* Practice the 100Daysofcode for a month before committing fully.
* Create a time table and sticking to it.
* Studying at the same time everyday, brains craves for learning python in that hour of the day.
* Missing few (~5) days is acceptable.

Ladies and gentleman, I present to you, #100DaysofCode with @ [animeshkbhadra ](https://twitter.com/animeshkbhadra "Twitter Handle")

## Day 14 | Tuesday 19 March 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

* Completed few regular expression tutorials from [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/regular-expressions-in-python)

### Thoughts ###

* Learned about counts in regular expressions.
* We can create expressions like these
	- `\w{3}` - Match any 3 word char
	- `\w{,3}` - Match 0,1,2 or 3 word char
	- `\w{3,}` - Match 3 or more char, no upper limit
	- `\w{3,5}` - Match 3,4 or 5 word char
	- `\w?` - Match 0 or 1 char
	- `\w*` - Match 0 or more
	- `\w+` - Match 1 or more
* We can also pass a variable in regular expression string.
	- `"\w{%s}" %count`
		+ `%s` - for string
		+ `%d` - for decimal
		+ `%f` - for float
* Sets basic was also checked.
	- `[abc]` - set of char a,b,c
	- `[a-z][A-Z][a-zA-Z]` - Char ranges
	- `[0-9]` - digit
	- `[^2]` - Not 2

## Day 05 | Tuesday 26 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

* There was a gap of 3 days.
* Started the [Date and Time](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/dates-and-times-in-python) module.

### Thoughts ###

* This course teaches about the date and time module of Python.
* Major modules in `datetime` are
	- `date`, `datetime`, `time`, `timedelta`, `timezone`, `tzinfo`- which is rarely used directly.
* Learned about `.today()`, `.combine()`, `.timestamp()` -  which returns the epoch time.
* We can format the time with help from `strftime()`
* We can create time with string format `strptime()`

## Day 01 | Tuesday 19 February 2019 ##

### Days Progress ###

I am learning Python from the learn python track of [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-python). I started this course, some days back, from now, will post regularly on behalf of #100DaysOfCode.

Today I have completed the Advanced Object Badge.

![Advance Object TreeHouse Badge.]({filename}../../../images/100DaysOfCode/python.png "Advance Object TreeHouse Badge.")

### Thoughts ###

Today I learned about:-

* `@property` : This decorator is used to convert a class method into a class property.
* `@property.setter` : This decorator is used to make the method set a class property.
* `@classmethod` : This is a decorator which takes a function as input works on it and returns another function as output.
