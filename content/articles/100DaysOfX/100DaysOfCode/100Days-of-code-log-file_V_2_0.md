Hello World!, You are about the witness the beginning of an epic second coming of the 100-Day coding journey, A story that great sages
will pass down from generation to generation. This quest will feature a potpourri of unfiltered joy, unrivaled pain, and 
unexpected epiphanies.

Some moments, I will be the smartest man alive. Others moments, I will be a stupid idiot. But each day, I will be a valiant warrior, fighting to develop and perfect the skills necessary to evolve into a true beast with these keys.

I have failed in my previous attempt for the challenge, which you can find [here]({filename}../../../articles/100DaysOfX/100DaysOfCode/100Days-of-code-log-file.md "First attempt for 100Daysofcode").

There are learning from the previous failure, here are the modification which was done to the challenge according to my handicap.

* Selected the resource in advance,

* Practice the 100Daysofcode for a month before committing fully.
* Create a time table and sticking to it.
* Studying at the same time everyday, brains craves for learning python in that hour of the day.
* Missing few (~5) days is acceptable.

### Days Progress ###

I am learning Python from the learn python track of [TreeHouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-python). I started this course, some days back, from now, will post regularly on behalf of #100DaysOfCode.

Today I have completed the Advanced Object Badge.

### Thoughts ###

Today I learned about:-

* `@property` : This decorator is used to convert a class method into a class property.
* `@property.setter` : This decorator is used to make the method set a class property.
* `@classmethod` : This is a decorator which takes a function as input works on it and returns another function as output.
