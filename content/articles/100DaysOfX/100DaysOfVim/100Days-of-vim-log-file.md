subtitle: Is It Worth the Time?
Summary: Vim is really hard to learn, and time and again I failed to use it consistently. I understand the basic of vim and can get some work done with VIM. I am targeting to become efficient in this. Hopefully the 100DaysOfVim will help me to be consistent.

![Real Programmers xkcd]({filename}../../../images/100DaysOfVim/real_programmers.png "Real programmers set the universal constants at the start such that the universe evolves to contain the disk with the data they want.")

What is the definition of a Real Programmer is open for interpretation. I have been using VIM for last couple of years to do the basic editing and was happy  with whatever I learn about using vim in the process. Deep within I always wanted to become a better user of vim, tried different experimentation which includes installing mindless plugins, copying from different vimrc files sometimes understanding and sometime not understanding the concepts. Moral of the story is nothing sticked to my brain or what we call muscle memory to use it efficiently.

Fortunately enough when I was struggling with the idea to become better at vim, this article [How To Learn Vim: A Four Week Plan ](https://medium.com/@peterxjang/how-to-learn-vim-a-four-week-plan-cd8b376a9b85) came along and I was immediately interested, clubbed this with the [100daysofx](http://100daysofx.com/) and I had a plan at becoming better at VIM. 

Through this log file, I will update what ever resource I will use and what ever practice I am doing everyday. God permits if I become good at vim in these 100 days it will be an achievement for me. Hoping for the best I hereby jump into the world of Real Programmers.
