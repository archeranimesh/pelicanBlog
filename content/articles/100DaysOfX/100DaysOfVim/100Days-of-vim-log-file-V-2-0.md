Summary: Vim is really hard to learn, time and again I have failed to use it consistently. I understand the basics of vim and can get some work done with VIM. I am targeting to become efficient at this. Hopefully the 100DaysOfVim will help me to be consistent.

I am starting this new journey into the world of VIM, with a hope that this time the mistakes of my past attempts will be rectified. This journey's goal is pre-decided so that there is no deviation from the plan of learning VIM. 

In the last attempt of learning VIM, I was doing the classic mistakes of learning vim as described by Mr. Bram Moolenaar in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6K4iIMlouI) video, that is, **Learn every feature the editor offers and use the most efficient command all the time.** 

The approach this time will be learning a little bit of commands in VIM and apply it daily for a few days, as it becomes part of the muscle memory move to the next set. In addition, I have also set my goals for this 100 Days to have a razor sharp focus and not deviating.

The goal of this **100DaysofVim** are:-

* Edit text effectively.
* Scroll and move in a file quickly.
* Navigate source code with ctags and key board shortcuts.
* Edit multiple files using buffers.
* No use of any vim plugins.
* Read and understand the vim help system.
* Integrate debugging with source code navigation in VIM.


## Day 1 - Monday 18 February 2019 ##

### Today's Progress ###

1. Complete the `vimtutor ` exercise.
2. Studied the quick reference in vim help.


### Thoughts ###
* Few commands which was very good.
	- Using `C` to change the text from the cursor till end of line.
	- Using `D` to delete the text from the cursor till end of line.
* Few Insert Mode commands.
	- `CTRL-T` : insert one shiftwidth of indent in front of line.
	- `CTRL-D` : deletes one shiftwidth of indent in front of line.
